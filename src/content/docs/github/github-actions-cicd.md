# Developer Platforms: GitHub Actions
## Introduction
GitHub Actions is a perfect example of a modern development platform that allows us to automate processes throughout the software lifecycle, including testing, building, and deploying applications. Preparing this case study is not only to help  understand GitHub Actions in more depth, but also to demonstrate my research and technical skills. This case study includes video demonstrations and configuration scripts that show how GitHub Actions can realistically be used in a development project. To describe GitHub Actions I used mostly GitHub Actions documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides

## Brief History

GitHub Actions is a part of GitHub so it's necessary to write some words about GitHub history at the beginning. Platform was founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon. The development of GitHub started in 2007, and the platform officially launched in April 2008. Initially, GitHub was designed as a platform for version control and collaboration, leveraging the distributed version control system Git, which was developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development.

- The initial development of the GitHub platform started on October 19, 2007. By April 2008, founders Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon had officially launched the site, which had previously been available in a beta version for a few months. Additionally, GitHub hosts an annual event known as GitHub Universe to showcase new features and developments.

- Originally, GitHub, Inc. operated without middle management, adopting a "self-management" approach where all employees acted as their own managers. This structure allowed employees to select projects that piqued their interest (known as open allocation), although salaries were determined by the CEO or other top executives who also decided on project goals and funding.

- Foundation and Early Development (2007-2008): GitHub was founded on February 8, 2008, by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Scott Chacon. The platform was developed as a collaborative environment for open-source software projects, utilizing the distributed version control system Git. The concept of "pull requests" was central to GitHub's functionality, allowing users to suggest changes to projects.
- Public Launch and Initial Growth (2008-2009): After a beta period, GitHub was publicly launched on April 10, 2008. It quickly gained traction in the developer community.
- By February 2009, GitHub boasted over 46,000 public repositories, and by July 2009, it reached 100,000 users.
- By the end of 2009, GitHub hosted 90,000 unique public repositories.
- Rapid Expansion (2010-2012): GitHub's user base and repository count continued to soar. By July 2010, GitHub announced it was hosting 1 million repositories.
- The platform supported projects in over 50 programming languages. In 2011, GitHub became the most popular open source forge. In July 2012, GitHub received a significant investment of $100 million from Andreessen Horowitz.
- Increased Adoption and Features (2012-2013): GitHub's popularity among developers and companies continued to grow. By 2012, the platform was used extensively not just by individual developers but also by large corporations and government organizations. By December 2012, GitHub had jumped to 2.8 million users. In 2013, it introduced features that catered to large enterprise users and reached 3 million users by January.
- Corporate and International Expansion (2014-2015): In 2014, GitHub faced internal challenges, including allegations of harassment which led to the resignation of Tom Preston-Werner. Despite these challenges, GitHub continued to grow, reaching 7 million projects by August 2013. By March 2015, GitHub was the largest host of source code globally with over 21.1 million repositories. In June 2015, GitHub expanded internationally by opening an office in Japan. By September 2015, GitHub had grown to 324 employees and 10 million users.

- On February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the third-largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.
- On June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.

## 1.	Introduction to GitHub Actions:
###	What GitHub Actions are and how they are integrated with GitHub, a code hosting and version control platform?

GitHub Actions is a functionality offered by the GitHub platform that allows to automate, customize and execute development processes directly in GitHub repositories. It is a tool for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) of software that enables automatic execution of scripts (so-called actions) in response to various events in the repository.

#### Key features of GitHub Actions:
##### A .Workflow Automation: 
- GitHub Actions allows you to create workflows that are defined in YAML files in the repository. Workflows can be triggered by various events on GitHub, for example push to a branch, creation of a pull request, release of a new version or time-scheduled events (cron jobs).

##### B. Flexibility: 
- Users can create their own actions (scripts) or use existing actions created by the GitHub community and available on the GitHub Marketplace. This gives you a lot of freedom in adapting CI/CD processes to the specific needs of the project.

##### C. GitHub Integration: 
- As a tool built into GitHub, Actions are strongly integrated with other GitHub features such as GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and GitHub Pages. This makes it easier to manage the entire software lifecycle in one place.

##### D. Container support: 
- GitHub Actions supports running tasks in Docker containers, which allows for even greater control over the environment in which actions and workflows run.

##### E. Security: 
- Mechanisms such as secrets allow for the safe storage and use of sensitive data (e.g. API keys, passwords) that are needed for the operation of scripts and integration with external services.

#### How does integration with GitHub work?
GitHub Actions is an integral part of GitHub, which means that all actions and workflows are managed and run directly from the GitHub UI or via configuration files placed in repositories. Users can easily monitor the results of each running workflow, view logs, manage notifications, and debug issues without leaving the GitHub platform.

GitHub Actions makes it easier to integrate DevOps practices into the daily work of development teams, enabling the automation of testing, building and deploying applications in a much more efficient and controlled way.
