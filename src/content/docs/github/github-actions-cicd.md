# Developer Platforms: GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a perfect example of a modern development platform that allows us to automate processes throughout the software lifecycle, including testing, building, and deploying applications. Preparing this case study is not only to help  understand GitHub Actions in more depth, but also to demonstrate my research and technical skills. This case study includes video demonstrations and configuration scripts that show how GitHub Actions can realistically be used in a development project. To describe GitHub Actions I used mostly GitHub Actions documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides

## 1.	Introduction to GitHub Actions:
###	What GitHub Actions are and how they are integrated with GitHub, a code hosting and version control platform?

GitHub Actions is a functionality offered by the GitHub platform that allows to automate, customize and execute development processes directly in GitHub repositories. It is a tool for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) of software that enables automatic execution of scripts (so-called actions) in response to various events in the repository.

#### Key features of GitHub Actions:
##### A .Workflow Automation: 
- GitHub Actions allows you to create workflows that are defined in YAML files in the repository. Workflows can be triggered by various events on GitHub, for example push to a branch, creation of a pull request, release of a new version or time-scheduled events (cron jobs).

##### B. Flexibility: 
- Users can create their own actions (scripts) or use existing actions created by the GitHub community and available on the GitHub Marketplace. This gives you a lot of freedom in adapting CI/CD processes to the specific needs of the project.

##### C. GitHub Integration: 
- As a tool built into GitHub, Actions are strongly integrated with other GitHub features such as GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and GitHub Pages. This makes it easier to manage the entire software lifecycle in one place.

##### D. Container support: 
- GitHub Actions supports running tasks in Docker containers, which allows for even greater control over the environment in which actions and workflows run.

##### E. Security: 
- Mechanisms such as secrets allow for the safe storage and use of sensitive data (e.g. API keys, passwords) that are needed for the operation of scripts and integration with external services.

#### How does integration with GitHub work?
GitHub Actions is an integral part of GitHub, which means that all actions and workflows are managed and run directly from the GitHub UI or via configuration files placed in repositories. Users can easily monitor the results of each running workflow, view logs, manage notifications, and debug issues without leaving the GitHub platform.

GitHub Actions makes it easier to integrate DevOps practices into the daily work of development teams, enabling the automation of testing, building and deploying applications in a much more efficient and controlled way.

## 2.	Basic functions and capabilities:
-	GitHub Actions allows users to create workflows that automatically run when certain events occur in the repository (e.g. push, pull request).
-	List common tasks that can be automated using GitHub Actions, such as building applications, testing, deploying to servers or the cloud.

## 3.	Usage examples:
-	Present a specific example or case study showing how GitHub Actions was used to automate CI/CD processes in a software project.

## 4.	Advantages and disadvantages:
-	Strengths of GitHub Actions such as GitHub integration, ease of setup, scalability, as well as weaknesses which may include limitations in available tools, cost for very large projects, etc.

## 5.	The future of GitHub Actions:
-	Speculate on future trends and developments of GitHub Actions as DevOps and automation grow in popularity.
