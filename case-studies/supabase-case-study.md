## Introduction

Supabase is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform. Supabase uses Postgres and provides developers a range odf services e.g. cloud-hosted database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and API generation services. Some of the advantages of Supabase are easy-to-use APIs, SDKs, and client libraries for common programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Morover, it is designed to be scalable, customizable and secure.

Since Supabase is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, it is free to use and modify. These makes it an ideal choice for businesses and enterprises of all sizes and it has gained popularity among developers, making it a good alternative to other BaaS platforms e.g Firebase, Parse, Appwrite, Nhost and AWS Amplify.

## Brief History

Supabase was founded in January 2020 by Paul Copplestone and Tan Li Hau as an open-source alternative to Firebase. In April 2020, they launched the alpha version of Supabase with capability to provide a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database with a RESTful API and real-time subscriptions. Supabase received seed funding from investors including Mozilla. In 2021 the first public version was launched, making Supabase available to all developerss. In the same year, Supabase received further funding in the range of $30M. Since then Supabase continue to develop and increase its user base. Curretly, there are several ongoing developments and updates to Supabase with a significant contribution from the developer community.

## Strengths

Supabase has several strengths as outlines below:

- It is an Open-source platform where the user commuinty contributes to its development.

- Supabase provides a simple and easy-to-use solution with straightforward APIs and SDKs. These makes it accessible for developers of different skill levels.

- It provides all necessary services for a backend solution e.g. cloud-hosted database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and API generation.

- It is flexible with the possibility of customization allowing developers more control.

- Being a open source solution Supabase is cost effective option as there are no upfront costs and potential for cost savings in hosting and infrastructure.

## Weaknesses

The weaknesses of Supabase can be outlined as follows:

- It is relatively new BaaS platform compared to Firebase or AWS Amplify. So, it has a much smaller user community. In addition, it will require the users to invest some time to adapt and familiar themselves with its APIs and SDKs.

- Some of established platforms can have more features. Supabase focussed mainly on backend services and do not have hosting services as in Firebase. Thus it is natural that many developers will prefer to use different solutions for their frontend applications.

## Market Comparison

Here are some of the top Backend as a Service (BaaS) platforms.
1.Firebase by Google:
2.AWS Amplify by Amazon Web Services (AWS):
3.Microsoft Azure Mobile Apps
4.Parse Platform:
5.Backendless
6.Kinvey

- Firebase offers more services than Supabase.

- No vendor locking ( Firebase owned by Google, firebase we canÂ´t move our application or export to other platform.)

## Getting started:

Sign up for an account: Go to the Supabase website (https://supabase.io/) and sign up for a free account. You will need to provide an email address, password, and agree to the terms of service.

Create a new project: Once you have an account, you can create a new project in the Supabase dashboard. This will create a new instance of Supabase for your project and provide you with the necessary credentials to access the Supabase services.

Install the Supabase client library: Supabase provides client libraries for various programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and others. You will need to install the appropriate client library for your chosen language in your development environment.

Connect to your Supabase project: Using the credentials provided in the Supabase dashboard, you can connect to your Supabase project using the client library in your application code. This will allow you to interact with the Supabase services, such as the database, authentication, and real-time subscriptions.

Use Supabase services in your application: Once connected, you can start using the Supabase services in your application code. For example, you can create and manage database tables, authenticate users, and perform real-time data synchronization using Supabase's APIs and SDKs.

## Summary

Supabase is an open source BaaS platform that offers a rangle of backend services for both web and mobile applications. Is services include real-time data synchronization, built-in authentication and authorization. It is designed to be developer-friendly, scalable, flexible in addition to being cost-effectiveness. The main streingths of are that it is open-source and very user friendly. These allows for positive contributions to it developemnt from the user community. However, there are some limitations as it is comparatively new platform and doesnot have self-hosting capability.
